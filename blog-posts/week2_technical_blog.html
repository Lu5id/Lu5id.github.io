	<h3><u> Difference between "Div ID" and "Div Class" </u></h3>
		<p> One of my first questions when looking at HTML code was, "When is it appropriate to use Div ID or Div Class." Even though I've been doing quite a bit of research on it, I'm still not 100% clear on the subject, and really it just seems as more of a coding standard when to use each one. Regardless, the main difference is that you'll mainly be using "div class" and you'll only be using "div id" in specific cases.

	<h4><u> "div id" </h4></u>
		<p>
		You're supposed to use "div id" in unique cases. If there is a single element on a page that you want to have its own unique styling, you should use id. Theoretically, you could use "div ids" everywhere on the page, but this is inconvenient because often times you will want to style multiple elements on the page the same way.

		The biggest difference (to me) is on the style sheet you have to use a "#" followed by the elements name.

	<h4><u> "div class"</h4></u>
		<p>

		"div class" is the most common way you'll create div's on an HTML page. "div class" can be used multiple times and that makes styling the page easier, styling the "div classes" in one block as opposed to using "div id" and styling them all individually. 

		On the style sheet you have to use "." followed by the elements name to correctly style it.
