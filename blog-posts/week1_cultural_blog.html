			<h3> Kitchen vs. Table </h3>
		

			<p> From what I've experienced so far DBC seems like a revolutionary approach to education. I always used to complain about how we were taught in schools. If you didn't understand the math problem on the homework no worries, the teacher will put up the answer on the board for you the next day. I think this kind of teaching just breeds ineptness. Even though this first week was just an introduction of sorts to HTML, and even though grinding through all the problems that arose was challenging, it was way more fulfilling. It doesn't benefit anyone to spoon feed answers to someone, and I think this line of thinking is intrinsic to the DBC mantra. </p>

			<p> My favorite part about Shereef's Fireside Chat was the analogy he presented about us all being on the same path; and while some people might be a few hundred steps or even a few miles ahead of others, the total distance is so far that those inital leads are so insignifcant. That really gave me alot of hope as I waded through the unfamiliar territory that is HTML. I'm so excited to be a  part of this program. </p>
