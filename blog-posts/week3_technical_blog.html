			<p> According to Redmonk, a third party analysis firm, JavaScript is the most used programming language in the world, and for good reason.
			</p>

			<p> Pretty unanimously people agree that JavaScript is fast, easy to learn, and essential for anyone with programming aspirations. JavaScript is so popular because it is built into every modern web browser. The requirements for coding it and seeing your results are as easy as pushing your changes and refreshing your browser window. As people are shifting towards the use of computers more and more, having dynamic web pages is increasingly essential. I believe that since JavaScript is supported in all web browsers its growth in use and popularity are easily explained.

			<p> Lastly, and perhaps most important of all, is that it has literally zero overhead. With it being released for "server-side" and the amount of resources that are available online, anyone can learn and implement it for free!
