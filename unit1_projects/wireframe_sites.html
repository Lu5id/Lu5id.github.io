		<p> (I aplogize for the poor quality! I'll reupload the wireframes as soon as I get a better camera!) </p>
	<h3> Twitch.tv </h3>

		<a href="twitch.tv" target="_blank"><img src="images/twitch.jpg" height="40%" width="40%"></a>

		<p> Twitch.tv solves the issue of providing a location for avid video game fans to watch and follow their favorite players. Anyone can stream their desktop to the website where anyone in the world can tune in and watch them play. Some people are so big that within minutes of signing on they have 10's of thousands of viewers watching them live. Some of the visual challenges include making all the range of games accessible, and making the individual streamers accessible. They solve alot of the settings and favorite channel issues through their login and extremely useful sidebar. </p>

	<h3> Youtube.com </h3>

		<a href="youtube.com" target="blank"><img src="images/youtube.jpg" height="40%" width="40%"></a>

		<p> Youtube solves the issue of being the one-stop media/video upload site for users all over the globe. Youtube is so familiar to everyone that going in-depth on it seems like blowing smoke. I'm not sure exactly what visual problems would pop up to the developers at youtube, but to me the coolest feature of it is the related videos. Almost always after viewing a video there's one queued up that is exactly what I wanted to watch. Whatever algorithms they're using to dictate what filters onto that sidebar are brilliant. </p>

	<h3> Reddit.com </h3>

		<a href="reddit.com" target="blank"><img src="images/Reddit.jpg" height ="40%" width="40%"></a>

		<p> Reddit is the self-proclaimed 'Front Page of the Internet.' Reddit allows people to create a topic on anything at all that interests them. Users across the globe can vote 'up' or 'down' depending on the quality of the topic. From the front page of reddit, the threads with the highest amount of 'up' votes will be featured. From the front page users can narrow their range of topics based on their own interests. Reddits visual issue is simplicity and utility. Reddit filled this role because of how easy to use their interface is and how accessible it is to users of all ages. Reddit also has alot of customization options for users who want a more unique viewing experience. </p>
