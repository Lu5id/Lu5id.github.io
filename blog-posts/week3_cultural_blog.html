	<h3><u> Thinking Style: Concrete Random </u></h3>
		<p> The description I found when googling around for "Concrete Random" was this:
			<div class= "description">
				<p><i>30 % of the General Population falls into this category. You want to know what the point is to all this anyway. You are a great trouble-shooter and experimenter.You are the practical dreamer. You are very perceptive. You have lots of projects going and have trouble finishing any of them. Best Career Choices: Finance, Computers and Mental Health.</i>
				</p>
			</div>
		<p> Reading some of the assertions about Concrete Random thinkers, the parallels to myself are extremely close. I find it difficult to put stock into these personality identifier quizzes in general, but this one really hit home. I think the best part was this,<i>"Your validation process is done via practical demonstration and personal proof. You rarely accept outside authority."</i> Not only has this been the case for me my entire life (especially in a school setting) but I think it has a huge bearing on how I am learning to code. It's not good enough for me see something that works and imitate it, I have to know the WHY, which 9 times out of 10 makes my learning process much, much longer. Once I understand the why of something, my ability to retain it increases dramatically. I think for me personally, especially during Phase 0 I'm not going to have all of my questions answered in a satisfactory way. I think a lot of getting through this Phase 0 is accepting the fact that I wont have answers to everything, and have to keep muscling along.
