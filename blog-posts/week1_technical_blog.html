				<h2> Week 1 </h2>
				<article>
					<p> This week, I'll be talking about my favorite websites! </p>
				</article>

					<div class="column1">
					<h3> Twitch </h3>

					<div class="column2">
					<p><a href="twitch.tv" target="_blank"> Twitch.tv </a> is the one-stop location for people who are interested in video games. On this website anyone can live stream games from their PC, and people can watch it. Twitch has become the number one viewing platform for professional games, as well as individual streamers. Through the website you can create an account, Follow your favorite streamers, and even subscribe to individual channels for a monthly fee that will give you bonus content. On the homepage of the site, they have a list of featured streamers, so the moment you open the page you're redirected to a currently popular page. The website is simple, concise, has a great toolbar, and filled a niche role. From the homepage you can find everything you need, with a quick search based on users, or games you're interested in. As I said earlier, the site gives the option for you to subscribe to your favorite streamers or channels. In doing so you directly support them, and twitch takes a commission off every transaction.

					<h3>Youtube</h3>
					<a href="youtube.com" target="_blank"><img src="images/youtube.png" height="40%" width="40%"></a>
					</div>
					
					<div class="column2">
					<p> When asked to list 3 websites that I frequent the most, I wanted to avoid <a href="youtube.com" target="_blank"> Youtube </a>, but upon further thought, there isn't a single website that I visit more in a day than Youtube. Immediately when you get to the website, if you've used it before, they will post videos on your homepage that cater to your specific interests. This website solves the problem of having a one stop location for people all over the world to upload their videos and media. The search engine is particularly good, giving you many options in the Advanced Search menu that will almost always find the video you're searching for. My appreciation for the site was diminished when it was acquired by Google and became ad-based, but with AdBlock Plus, that's never been much of an issue.
					Not much else to say, Youtube is Youtube.

					<h3>Reddit</h3>

					<h3>Reddit</h3>
					<p><a href="reddit.com" target="_blank"> Reddit </a> is the home page of the internet, and rightfully so. Reddit is simple, concise and all-encompassing. I find it interesting that Reddit became the popular forum for all users, given so many alternatives and precursors. Nevertheless, Reddit is so simple to use I'm sure that's where the majority of the appeal comes from. Reddit has nothing particularly aesthetically pleasing, it follows a fairly standard forum format, people post topics which are open to comment from other users. Then users can come in and upvote or downvote a specific comment, or forum, and from there comments and forums are sorted by the number of upvotes. The result being that the forums with the most popularity, and the comments within them appear at the top of the News Feed. While the site takes a short amount of time to navigate, once you have the hang of it it's extremely simple.
